<li>
<a href="/Data Structure/prog1.c">Use Stack operations to do the following:
<ul>
    <li>Assign to a variable name Y the value of the third element from the top of the stack and leave the stack undisturbed.</li>
    <li>Given an arbitrary integer n pop out the top n elements. A message should be displayed if an unusual condition is encountered</li>
    <li>Assign to a variable name Y the value of the third element from the bottom of the stack and keep the stack undisturbed.</li>
</ul>
