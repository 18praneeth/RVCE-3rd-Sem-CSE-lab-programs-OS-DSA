### List of Programs

<ol>

<li>
Use Stack operations to do the following:
<ul>
    <li>Assign to avariable name Y the value of the third element from the top of the stack and keep the stack undisturbed.</li>
    <li>Given an arbitrary integer n pop out the top n elements. A message should be displayed if an unusual condition is encountered</li>
    <li>iii)	Assign to a variable name Y the value of the third element from the bottom of the stack and keep the stack undisturbed.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
Write a C program that parses Infix arithmetic expressions to Postfix arithmetic expressions using a Stack.
</li>

<li>
Write a C program to simulate the working of Messaging System in which a message is placed in a circular Queue by a Message Sender, a message is removed from the circular queue by a Message Receiver, which can also display the contents of the Queue.
</li>

<li>
Implement a program to multiply two polynomials using single linked list.
</li>

<li>
Write a C program to implement addition of long positive integers using circular single linked list with header node.
</li>

<li>
Design a doubly linked list to represent sparse matrix. Each node in the list can have the row and column index of the matrix element and the value of the element. Print the complete matrix as the output.
</li>

<li>Write a C program to create Binary Tree and provide insertion and deletion operations and to traverse the tree using In-order, Preorder and Post order (recursively)</li>

<li>Given a String representing a parentheses-free infix arithmetic expression, implement a program to place it in a tree in the infix form. Assume that a variable name is a single letter. Traverse the tree to produce an equivalent postfix and prefix expression string.</li>

<li>Write a C program to implement Hashing using Linear probing. Implement insertion, deletion, search and display.</li>

<li>Write a C program to implement priority queue to insert, delete and display the elements.</li>
